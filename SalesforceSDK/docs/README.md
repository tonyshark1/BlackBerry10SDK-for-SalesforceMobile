SalesforceMobileSDK-BlackBerry10
================================

This repository contains the SalesforcesSDK for BB10 cascades applications and a sample application that has the minimum required setup to demonstrate how to use the SDK.

The main APIs in the SalesforceSDK are found in the SFAuthenticationManager class and SFRestAPI class. The SFAuthenticationManager class provides APIs for the application to manage the oAuth 2.0 authentication process. The SFRestAPI class provides a set of interfaces to work with force.com REST APIs. The SFRestAPI handles the necessary step required to send a request (such as refreshing an access token when its expired).
